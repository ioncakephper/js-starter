- **Professional Release Workflow**: Integrated `standard-version` to automate version bumping and `CHANGELOG.md` generation based on the Conventional Commits specification.
- **Automated GitHub Releases**: A GitHub Action that automatically creates a new release on GitHub with generated notes whenever a version tag is pushed.
- **One-Command Pre-Commit Preparation**: A single `npm run ready` command that formats, lints, and updates all documentation, guaranteeing every commit is clean, consistent, and professional.
- **Robust Project Defaults**: Thoughtfully pre-configured with `.gitignore`, `.prettierignore`, and a ready-to-use Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher

### Using this Template

There are two ways to use this template: for a brand new project or to standardize an existing one.

#### For a New Repository

This is the recommended approach for new projects.

1.  Click the green **"Use this template"** button on the [main repository page](https://github.com/ioncakephper/js-starter).
2.  Select **"Create a new repository"**.
3.  Give your new repository a name and description.
4.  Clone your newly created repository to your local machine.
5.  Navigate into the project directory and install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
6.  You're all set! Start building your application in the `src` directory.

#### For an Existing Repository

You can also apply this template's configuration and workflow to an existing project. This is a manual process, but it's a great way to standardize your tooling.

1.  **Clone this template** to a separate directory on your local machine.
2.  **Copy the configuration files** from the template's root into your project's root. This includes:
    - `.github/` (for GitHub Actions CI)
    - `scripts/` (for documentation automation)
    - `.eslintignore`
    - `.eslintrc.json`
    - `.gitignore`
    - `.prettierignore`
    - `.prettierrc.json`
    - `jest.config.mjs`
3.  **Merge `package.json` settings**:
    - Copy the `devDependencies` from this template into your project's `package.json`.
    - Copy the `scripts`, `scriptDescriptions`, and `scriptCategories` objects into your `package.json`. You may need to merge them with your existing scripts.
    - Copy the `engines` block to enforce the Node.js version.
4.  **Install the new dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Update Documentation**:
    - Copy or merge the contents of this `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` into your own project's documentation.
    - Run `npm run docs:all` to generate the documentation sections based on your project's new structure and scripts.

## üöÄ Available Scripts

This template includes a set of scripts designed to streamline development, enforce quality, and automate documentation.

<!-- START AVAILABLE SCRIPTS -->
<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN npm run docs:scripts TO UPDATE -->

### Automated Documentation

- `npm run docs:all`: A convenience script that updates the table of contents, available scripts, and project structure in the README.
- `npm run docs:links`: Validates all hyperlinks in Markdown files to ensure they are not broken.
- `npm run docs:scripts`: Updates the "Available Scripts" section in `README.md` with this script.
- `npm run docs:structure`: Updates the project structure tree in `README.md`.
- `npm run toc`: Generates a Table of Contents in `README.md` using `doctoc`.

### Code Quality & Formatting

- `npm run check`: A convenience script that runs the linter.
- `npm run fix`: A convenience script that formats code and then fixes lint issues.
- `npm run format`: Formats all JavaScript, Markdown, and JSON files with Prettier.
- `npm run lint`: Lints all JavaScript and Markdown files using ESLint.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fixes linting issues in all JavaScript and Markdown files.

### Core Development

- `npm run start`: Runs the application using `node src/index.js`.
- `npm run test`: Runs all tests with Jest and generates a coverage report.
- `npm run test:watch`: Runs Jest in watch mode, re-running tests on file changes.

### Release Management

- `npm run release`: Automates versioning and changelog generation using Conventional Commits.

### The "One-Click" Pre-Commit Workflow

- `npm run ready`: A convenience script to run before committing: updates all documentation and then formats and fixes all files.

## A Focus on Quality and Productivity

This starter template is more than just a collection of files; it's a workflow designed to maximize developer productivity and enforce high-quality standards from day one. The core philosophy is to **automate the tedious and error-prone tasks** so you can focus on what matters: building great software.

### The Cost of Stale Documentation

In many projects, the `README.md` is the first thing to become outdated. Manually updating the project structure diagram or the list of available scripts is a chore that is easily forgotten. Similarly, broken links in documentation can frustrate users and create a perception of a poorly maintained project.

`js-starter` solves this problem with its custom documentation scripts:

- `scripts/update-readme-structure.js`: Saves you from manually drawing out file trees. What might take 5-10 minutes of careful, manual work (and is often forgotten) is now an instant, accurate, and repeatable command.
- `scripts/update-readme-scripts.js`: Ensures that your project's capabilities are always documented. It reads directly from `package.json`, so the documentation can't lie. It even reminds you to describe your scripts, promoting good habits.
- `scripts/check-links.js`: Automatically validates every hyperlink in your Markdown files. This prevents the "link rot" that plagues many documentation sites, ensuring that every reference is a trustworthy one.

### The Power of Workflow Scripts

Chaining commands together is a simple but powerful concept. The `fix`, `docs:all`, and `ready` scripts are designed to create a seamless development experience.

- Instead of remembering to run `prettier` then `eslint --fix`, you just run `npm run fix`.
- Instead of running three separate documentation commands, you just run `npm run docs:all`.
- And most importantly, before you commit, you run `npm run ready`. This single command is your pre-flight check. It guarantees that every commit you push is not only functional but also perfectly formatted, linted, and documented. This discipline saves countless hours in code review and prevents messy commit histories.

By embracing this automation, `js-starter` helps you build better software, faster.

## üì¶ Release & Versioning

This project uses a combination of `standard-version` and GitHub Actions to provide a seamless, automated release process.

This workflow relies on commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification.

### How it Works

1.  **Local Release Preparation**: Running `npm run release` uses `standard-version` to:
    - Bump the version number in `package.json`.
    - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with all the new changes.
    - Commit the changes and create a new version tag locally (e.g., `v1.1.0`).
2.  **Optional Publishing**: A `posttag` hook then prompts you, asking if you want to publish the new version to the npm registry.
3.  **Automated GitHub Release**: When you push the new tag to GitHub (`git push --follow-tags`), a workflow is automatically triggered to:
    - Create a new "Release" on your repository's Releases page.
    - Use the tag as the release title.
    - Generate polished release notes from your commit history.

### Creating a New Release

The following steps should be performed by a project maintainer with push access to the `main` branch:

1.  **Ensure your local `main` branch is up-to-date** with all the changes you want to release.
2.  **Run the release command**. This will start the interactive release process.

    ```bash
    npm run release
    ```

3.  **Follow the Prompts**: The script will guide you through the release:
    - First, it will ask if you want to **publish the package to npm**.
    - Second, it will ask if you want to **push the new commit and tag to GitHub**. This step is what triggers the automated GitHub Release creation.

If you answer "yes" to both prompts, the entire release process is handled for you. If you choose to skip a step, the script will provide instructions on how to complete it manually later.

For a dry run to see what changes would be made without actually changing any files, you can use `npm run release -- --dry-run`.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Linting for Documentation

This project uses the [`eslint-plugin-jsdoc`](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc) package to enforce that all functions, classes, and methods are properly documented using JSDoc comments. This helps maintain a high level of code quality and makes the codebase easier for new and existing developers to understand.

### How to Check for Missing Documentation

You can check the entire project for missing or incomplete docblocks by running the standard linting command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

ESLint will scan your JavaScript files and report any undocumented code as a warning.

### Example

Consider the following function in your code without any documentation:

```javascript
function calculateArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}
```

When you run `npm run lint`, ESLint will produce a warning similar to this:

```plaintext
/path/to/your/project/src/your-file.js
  1:1  warning  Missing JSDoc for function 'calculateArea'  jsdoc/require-jsdoc
```

To fix this, you would add a JSDoc block that describes the function, its parameters, and what it returns. Most modern code editors (like VS Code) can help by generating a skeleton for you if you type `/**` and press Enter above the function.

**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the area of a rectangle.
 * @param {number} width The width of the rectangle.
 * @param {number} height The height of the rectangle.
 * @returns {number} The calculated area.
 */
function calculateArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}
```

After adding the docblock, running `npm run lint` again will no longer show the warning for this function.
